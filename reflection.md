## Reflection Week 06

Comparing my DynamicArray class to your posted solution helped me see both my strengths and gaps. I’m proud to see that the core logic of my class, especially the methods `add`, `remove(int)`, and `countOf` — matched the posted solution. My code compiles, passes tests, and maintains correct logic for resizing and element manipulation. I I believe that this shows I have a strong grasp of how dynamic arrays work under the hood.

However, I did notice a few areas where I deviated from expectations, either by misunderstanding the conventions or by overcomplicating. For example, in my `contains` method, I rewrote the search logic instead of simply calling `indexOf`, which sort of violates the Programmer's Pact rule about avoiding redundant logic. Additionally, my `indexOf` method uses a ternary return, resulting in two return statements, while the posted solution uses just one which is a small difference, but something I’ll be more mindful of going forward. I also hardcoded the number `2` in `resize()` instead of referencing the `RESIZE_FACTOR` constant, which could hurt maintainability and readability.

One major learning takeaway is the importance of **code readability**. It’s not just about making the code work; it’s about writing it in a clean, reusable, and professional way.I took more time on this assignment compared to previous ones and revisited the Pact before writing and implemeneting each method. For fixes in the future, I’ll allow more time for review and debugging. If I stick to this plan, I think I'll write cleaner and more natural / professional code over time.
